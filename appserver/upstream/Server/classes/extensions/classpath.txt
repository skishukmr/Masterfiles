# This file allows customers to extend the classpath that is used to run Ariba
# application.  Extending the classpath here affects both command-line programs, such
# as initdb, and also the Application Server.
#
# IF YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THIS FILE, you must run the rebuildclasspath utility
# to cause these changes to be pushed to the application server.
#
# For more information, consult the Ariba API manual.
#
# Format of this file
# -------------------
# Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.  Wildcards that occur in
# this file, such as *.jar, are expanded at runtime.  Entries that are not
# absolute paths are interpreted relative to the application installation
# directory.  At this time environment variable references are not supported.
# It does not hurt to have references to files that don't exist (they will be
# silently ignored).

# here, in package hierarchy of course.

# Customers using a SQLServer database need the JDBC classes for that system.
# We are using the classes provided by WebLogic in this case. These classes are
# included in the main "weblogic.jar" that is located in the BEA installation
# directory.  The installer/configurator will update the line below with the
# resolved location of this jar.
