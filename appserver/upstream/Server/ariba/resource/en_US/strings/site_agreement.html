  (collectively, &quot;Regulations&quot;) regarding Your Site Use and Your bidding 
  for products or services through the Ariba Site. Note, however, that while the 
  Ariba Site is available worldwide, it is a single website engineered and designed 
  based on U.S. principles (thus, Ariba cannot and does not commit that the Ariba 
  Site itself meets all Regulations in all countries).</p>
<p><b>15. Relationship of Parties.</b> You acknowledge that in connection with the On-Line 
  Events, Ariba provides certain administrative services on behalf of Sponsor. 
  You understand that You are not our client; Ariba's client is the Sponsor (that 
  is, Ariba is an independent contractor for Sponsor). As part of Ariba performing 
  services to its client, the Sponsor, you consent to Ariba providing to the Sponsor 
  all communications by you during the On-Line Events. No agency, partnership, 
  joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended 
  nor created by this Agreement. For all actual or potential transactions between 
  You and the Sponsor of an On-Line Event, Ariba shall not hold title to, handle 
  the physical distribution of, nor be held liable for failures of any components, 
  materials, services related to such On-Line Event.</p>
<p><b>16. Miscellaneous.</b> Any notice (&quot;Notice&quot;) You send Ariba under this 
  Agreement must be in writing and in the English language, where such Notice 
  relates to the Agreement or other legal issues. No failure or delay in exercising 
  any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any partial exercise 
  of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise (except that if You 
  experience any difficulty or error during an On-Line Event, You must notify 
  Ariba immediately, or else You waive any objection or claim relating to such 
  difficulty or error). You may not assign or transfer this Agreement without 
  the prior written consent of Ariba. Ariba may assign our interest in this Agreement 
  to any now-existing or future direct or indirect subsidiary of Ariba, Inc., 
  or pursuant to any assignment of the Ariba Site, or any corporate sale or restructuring. 
  We may also assign or delegate certain of our rights and responsibilities under 
  this Agreement to independent contractors or other third parties. If any provision 
  of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to 
  be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to 
  the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in 
  full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement shall be deemed to have 
  been made in, and shall be construed pursuant to the laws of the State of California 
  and the federal U.S. laws applicable therein, excluding its conflict of laws 
  provisions, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International 
  Sale of Goods. Any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall 
  be instituted in a state or federal court in San Francisco, Santa Clara or San 
  Mateo County, California (the &quot;Selected Venue(s)&quot;), and each party 
  hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in such counties. Both You and Ariba 
  hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to take any and all steps which 
  may be necessary in order to: (i) confer jurisdiction on the Selected Venue; 
  and (ii) facilitate the enforcement, by a court where a party is domiciled, 
  of any judgment given by a court in the Selected Venue. If suit is brought under 
  this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney's 
  fees, court costs, and expert witness fees. If there is any conflict between 
  the term of this Agreement and a Site Contract, the terms of the Site Contract 
  shall control as to any such conflict. &quot;Site Contract&quot; means a contract 
  signed by You and Ariba, where such contract is on the subject of You submitting 
  bids on the Ariba Site and where such contract expressly supersedes any online 
  terms of use applicable to the Ariba Site. You agree to be bound by the most 
  current version of this Agreement that is posted on the Ariba Site. The English 
  version of this Agreement shall govern in the event of any conflict or substantive 
  translation changes into a non-English language. You acknowledge that bidding 
  or transaction documents between You and the Sponsor can only be exchanged if 
  both You and the Sponsor are registered on the Ariba Site and in good standing 
  with the Ariba Site. Each party acknowledges that any breach of the provisions 
  of the Agreement may cause irreparable damage to the other party and that a 
  remedy at law may be inadequate. Therefore, in addition to any and all other 
  legal or equitable remedies, a party will be entitled to injunctive relief for 
  any breach of this Agreement. All article or section headings, or exhibit names, 
  are for reference and convenience only and shall not be considered in the interpretation 
  of the Agreement. </p>
<p><b>17. Communicating with You.</b> Any communication sent via email by Ariba to the 
  designated contacts (either the primary or secondary contacts) You provide during 
  the registration process or User sign-up process shall constitute valid notice 
  from Ariba to You. You acknowledge and agree to keep Ariba informed in a timely 
  manner of any change in the designated contacts or their correct email addresses. 
  Ariba is entitled to rely on the validity of the contact information (email 
  addresses, fax number, or otherwise) for the designated contacts You provide 
  Ariba, even if Ariba receives a response email (after Ariba sends an email to 
  a designated contact) that the email address is invalid or did not reach its 
  intended recipient, unless and until You have altered the designated contact 
  email address information within Your Ariba Site account. </p>

  solely responsible for:</p>

  Ariba receives from someone using your User name and password, Ariba is entitled 
  to consider such Transmission as having been sent by You.</p>
<p><b>b.</b> Complying with all applicable privacy, consumer and other laws and regulations 
  with respect to Your (i) provision, use and disclosure of the Billing Data; 
  (ii) use of the Ariba Site. </p>
<p><b>c. Posting on the Ariba Site only Data for which you have a right to reproduce 
  and disclose to Sponsor and Ariba.</b> You will indemnify Ariba for any third party 
  claim brought against Ariba alleging that Data you posted on the Ariba Site
