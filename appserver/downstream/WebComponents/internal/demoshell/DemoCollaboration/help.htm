<h1>Network Simulator</h1>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
The network simulator allows you to basically perform punch-ins to buyer without having to be connected
to the Ariba Network. The simulator looks (apart from a few details) exactly like AN40, so this
simulator should be suitable for both testing as well as demo purposes. The simulator does NOT provide
any functionality that is supported natively on the network (such as PO flip), but it is possible to
set up your system so that orders and documents get routed to the real AN while using the simulator
for the punchin.
<h2>Logging in</h2>
To log in, use the name of the person you want to be rather than an e-mail address. No password is necessary.
For example, you can log on as "Joe Schmoe". If there is no user named "Joe Schmoe" in buyer, you will
be prompted to provide either the name of a supplier (This is the common supplier name, no the partitioned
supplier name, e.g. "Supplier 13") or, if collaboration requests already exist, you can select a supplier
from a dropdown. This information will be used to display the proper documents and will also be used upon
punch-in to associate the user with that supplier. If the user already exists, this step is not neccessary.
Note that if you were in a buyer session in the same window, you will be automatically logged out of that session
(since the demo system runs in its own buyer session).
<h2>Punching in</h2>
If you selected a new user above, the first punchin (either from a CLR or from the contracts punchin) will
create a new user in Buyer. You will get an error screen (exactly the same one you get on the AN) saying
that a new user was created. This user must then be approved (and usually be edited to provide accounting & ship-to
info). For the sample data, <i>adavis</i> has the permission to do so. Once the user has been approved, the punchin will succeed.
<b>Note: if the punch-in fails with a weird NPE, try to set up your InternalURL in the AppInfo.xml to be a non-ssl URL
(like http://hostname.ariba.com:8050 instead of https://hostname.ariba.com).</b>  
<h2>Supported screens</h2>
Any link that doesn't work does nothing (rather than giving you an error screen). The following things work:
<ul>
<li>Help<br>this screen</li>
<li>Logout</li>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Technical Settings<br>Configure dummy routing</li>
<li>Inbox<br/>Leads to collaboration requests</li>
<li>Collaboration Requests (under Starting Points)</br>Leads to collaboration requests</li>
<li>Invoicing->Create Contract Invoice<br/>Leads to contract invoicing punchin page</li>
<li>Inbox/Collaboration Requests -> Time Sheets<br>Leads to time sheet list (can't do anything there, i.e.
clicking on time sheet doesn't do anything).
</ul>
Note that all data (Collaboration Requests, Time Sheets) are pulled from the buyer database (note that only a limited set of items is loaded (20 or so) to avoid slow page loads), 
so you see an
actual list of documents. It also means that there will only be a list of docs from one buyer, this may be a
point that needs to be talked to.
<h2>Dummy routing</h2>
The simulator will receive requests instead of the Network. If you are hooked up to the Network, you may
want to show the requests there as well. The simulator will still work, since it runs off the Database.
By default (every time you restart the instance), the CollaborationRequest and Time Sheets are simulated,
orders are not. You can enable simulation for orders - that way orders are not routed to the network.
