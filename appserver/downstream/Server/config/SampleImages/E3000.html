        generation of network-based business programs-SAP R/3,
        Oracle Financials, PeopleSoft Human Resources-you need
        application servers with tremendous network throughput
        and processing power. Plus very high levels of
        availability. The Enterprise 3000 is the first server to
        offer all that in a compact, easily affordable package. </a></p>
        <h2><a name="features">Industry-leading reliability

        <p><a name="features">The Enterprise 3000 is well suited
        for business-critical applications because it gives you
        all of the industry-leading reliability features found in
        our high-end servers: The ability to tolerate
        power-supply failures with no system disruption. The
        ability to service most components while the system
        continues to run. </a></p>
        <p><a name="features">Even the ability to predict
        potential failures with </a><a href="/servers/symon.html">Solstice<font

        a system monitor that will automatically warn the system
        administrator and SunService personnel so preventive
        action can be taken. </p>

        price class-are not available even in most large-scale
        systems. </p>
        <h2>Delivering true investment protection.</h2>
        <p>As an application server, the Enterprise 3000 delivers
        unprecedented performance. It unites the power of up to
        six UltraSPARC<font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>
        processors, the fast I/O of our 2.6-GB/sec Gigaplane<font
        size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font> system interconnect,
        high-bandwidth networking, high-speed disk I/O, and up to
        6 GB of main memory. Its modular design means that you
        can continue to upgrade the performance of the system.
        Add more CPUs, I/O channels, and memory as needed.
        Incorporate new technologies as they become available.
        This system delivers true investment protection. </p>
        <p>Like all Sun servers, the Enterprise 3000 comes with <a
        href="/solaris/solaris.html">Solaris<font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font></a>,
        the most popular and advanced networked computing
        environment that supports over 10,000 applications,

        management solutions. It is backed by <a
