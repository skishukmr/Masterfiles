        <p><font color="#000000" size="4">Sun Ultra 2 is the
        highest-performing desktop system of the UltraSPARCTM
        product family. The Ultra 2 system incorporates the
        latest advances and technology in multiple processing,
        CPU, graphics, I/O, networking, and memory design. It
        also offers increased upgradability and expandability
        relative to the Ultra 1 system. <br>
        From 3-D mechanical design to medical imaging, from
        financial modeling to simulation and analysis, the Sun
        Ultra 2 system delivers all the power, multiprocessing
        throughput, I/O, and memory needed for today's demanding
        technical and business applications. Wherever the highest
        performance is a must, that is where the Ultra 2 system
        excels. <br>
        <br>
        The Ultra 2 desktop begins with the 64-bit UltraSPARCTM
        microprocessor, in a single- or dual-processor
        configuration. These microprocessors, housed on simple
        plug-in modules, combine high clock speeds with an
        efficient four-way superscalar design that yields
        industry-leading integer and floating-point performance.
        They are surrounded by balanced technologies that
        together deliver outstanding performance in even the most
        compute-intensive applications. <br>
        <br>
        For instance, the UltraSPARC Port Architecture (UPA)
        interface unleashes the processors' incredible power.
        Based on a crossbar-switched architecture, this
        interconnect enables multiple simultaneous data transfers
        and provides an order of magnitude more bandwidth than
        previous bus-based technologies. Because data moves
        between processors, memory, and I/O more efficiently,
        transfers are faster than ever-giving you greatly
        increased performance. <br>
        <br>
        And UltraSPARC's revolutionary Visual Instruction Set
        (VIS) on-chip multimedia, graphics, and imaging
        technology delivers a whole new world of networked
        digital media to the desktop. <br>
        <br>
        Plus, with vast amounts of memory capacity at your
        disposal, you have enough horsepower to drive even the
        most demanding applications. The Sun Ultra 2 system's
        fast/wide, 20-MB/sec. SCSI-2 interface delivers
        accelerated performance from those same applications you
        depend on most. <br>
        <br>
        The Ultra 2 system is also binary compatible with our
        entire product family. That means you can take advantage
        of SolarisTM, the industry's most powerful and popular
        UNIX®environment, and the more than 10,000 applications
        that run-and run best-on the SPARCTM/Solaris platform,
        without recompilation. <br>
        <br>
        What Is New with Ultra 2?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        &#149;More configurations<br>
        <br>
        The Ultra 2 system now includes 200-MHz and 300-MHz
        uni-processor models, and 167-MHz, 200-MHz, and 300-MHz
        dual-processor models.<br>
        <br>
        &#149;Improved CPU and graphics performance<br>
        <br>
        UPA interconnect speed has been increased from 83 MHz to
        100 MHz on 200-MHz and 300-MHz Ultra 2 systems. UPA runs
        at 83 MHz on 167-MHz Ultra 2 systems, but can be
        increased to 100 MHz when the system is upgraded to a
        faster processor. Additionally, in 200-MHz and 300-MHz
        Ultra 2 systems, faster application-specific integrated
        circuits (ASICs) on Creator3D combined with higher UPA
        bandwidth raise graphics performance by more than 20
        percent over the Creator3D graphics on 167-MHz Ultra 2
        systems.<br>
        <br>
        &#149;Greater memory expansion<br>
        <br>
        Ultra 2 systems now support up to 2 GB of system memory
        using 128-MB SIMMs, up from 1 GB. <br>
