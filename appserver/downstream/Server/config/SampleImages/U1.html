        <h2>Product Overview</h2>
        <h3>UltraComputing<font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>-High-Performance
        Graphics, Network, I/O, and UltraSPARC<font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>
        CPU</h3>
        <p>With Ultra 1, Sun Microsystems Computer Company (SMCC)
        is again raising the level of performance and
        functionality in affordable desktop systems to
        unprecedented heights. The Ultra 1 performance level
        enables a whole new class of applications on the desktop.
        With a combination of exceptional processor speed,
        high-bandwidth networking, accelerated graphics, and
        outstanding application performance, the Ultra 1 series
        from Sun inaugurates a new era of computing. It is called
        UltraComputing. Add a SunPC 586 <b>compatibility card</b>
        or the Macintosh Application Environment and you can run
        all of the productivity applications your company
        requires.</p>
        <h3>The best trends in computing converge in a powerful
        desktop series.</h3>
        <p>Imagine what you can do with SPECint_95 7.44 and
        SPECfp_95 10.40 on your desktop. Super computer power on
        your desktop: Tightly integrated graphics, imaging, and
        multimedia technologies, and built-in 100-Mb/sec. Fast
        Ethernet networking. All at an affordable price.From
        research, development, and design to your most demanding
        business applications, Sun's Ultra 1 systems give you all
        the advanced features you need to improve both the speed
        and the quality of your work. </p>
        <h3>Technology for the impatient.</h3>
        <p>At the heart of the Ultra 1 is the 64-bit <b>UltraSPARC
        I</b><font size="2"><sup><b>TM</b></sup></font>
        microprocessor. Demonstrating the incredible scalability
        of the SPARC<font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>
        architecture, the <b>UltraSPARC I</b><font size="2"><sup><b>TM</b></sup></font>
        combines high processor speeds with an efficient four-way
        superscalar design for unprecedented desktop performance.
        Its nine-stage pipeline issues up to four instructions
        per cycle. In short, it's fast!</p>
        <p>To make the most of this powerful processor, our
        engineers developed the <b>Ultra Port Architecture (UPA)</b>,
        a crossbar-switched interconnect that enables multiple
        simultaneous data transfers, providing ten times the
        bandwidth of previous bus-based technologies. It has more
        memory bandwidth through the double data-width memory
        subsystem; a faster and wider industry-standard expansion
        bus, with the 64-bit SBus running at 25 MHz; faster I/O,
        with Fast/Wide SCSI functionality; and faster networking
        through the integrated Fast Ethernet port. Data transfers
        between processor, memory, I/O, and graphics are faster
        than ever before. Which means vastly improved application
        performance. </p>
        <p>The UltraSPARC processor's revolutionary <b>Visual
        Instruction Set (VIS)</b> - the industry's most flexible
        and comprehensive array of on-chip multimedia, graphics,
        and imaging technologies-delivers the new era of digital
        multimedia right to your desktop. </p>
        <p>The Ultra 1 maintains <b>100% binary compatibility</b>
        with Sun's entire product family. You can still run more
        than 10,000 solutions available on the SPARC/Solaris<font
        size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font> platform faster and better
        than ever before without recompiling. By leveraging and
        improving upon the features of the highly successful
        SPARCstation family, the Ultra 1 inherits and expands
        upon system modularity, expandability, and
        configurability-the hallmarks of all SPARCstation
        designs. </p>
        <h3>Network computing at its best.</h3>
        <p>As with all Sun systems, the Ultra 1 desktop will
        integrate into even the most complex multivendor
        environment. With <b>10/100-Mb/sec. Fast Ethernet</b> as
        a fully integrated, standard feature, the Ultra 1 Creator
        Series delivers 10X the bandwidth of other desktops while
        maintaining compatibility to existing 10-Mb/sec. Ethernet
        connections. If you opt for the entry-level Ultra 1, you
        can move up to 100-Mb/sec. networking by plugging in a
        SunFastEthernet<font size="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>
        adaptor. </p>
        <h3>Ultra 1 Graphics: The power to create.</h3>
        <p>In addition to the entry-level Ultra 1 170 TGX,
        cost-effective 8-bit graphics solutions for EDA, CASE,
        and a wide range of business applications, you can choose
        either the <b>Ultra 1 Creator</b> or <b>Ultra 1 Creator3D</b>
        - systems that lift visual computing to a new level of
        performance. </p>
        <p><b>Creator Graphics</b> gives you 24-bit,
        single-buffered 2-D graphics and imaging, enabling you to
        pan, zoom, rotate, convolve, and do color conversion at
        unprecedented speeds. Creator Graphics, tightly coupled
        to the processor through the UPA interconnect, allow the
        entire system to act as a graphics engine, utilizing
        floating-point processor speed, VIS capabilities, and
        memory capacity to their fullest. It is the ideal
        solution for full-color prepress, publishing, medical,
        GIS, or software development. The Ultra 1 Creator, with
        24-bit true-color graphics capability, was designed from
        the ground up for interactive graphics, imaging, video
        playback, and real-time information processing. </p>
        <p><b>Creator 3-D</b> offers all that and more: fast
        image processing, MPEG video decompression of Creator
        graphics, plus accelerated 24-bit, double- and Z-buffered
        3-D rendering. 3D-RAM technology combines the best
        features of DRAM, SRAM, and VRAM onto one chip-delivering
        up to 600 million pixel operations per second.The Ultra 1
        Creator3D system combines true-color graphics, high-speed
        image processing, video decompression, 3-D rendering
        capabilities. Creator 3D's perfect for visualization,
