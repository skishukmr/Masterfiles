        <p>You can receive multiple orders at one time, if the orders do not require 
          additional data. If My Supply Cabinet determines that any orders require asset 
          or other data, it prompts you to enter receipts for those orders individually.</p>
        <p>If a requisition contains line items that do not require a receipt 
          (as configured by your system administrator), those line items have 
          a status of Ordered, and not Received, when the requisition is fully 
          approved. The status of the line items does not change during the procurement 
          process; Ordered is the final status of those line items.</p>

        <p> The receiving process starts when an order has been sent to a supplier 
          and the supplier ships goods in exchange. When the shipment arrives, 
          the user who receives those items submits a receipt to acknowledge that 
          the items have arrived. Depending on your company's business rules, 
          receiving can be done by a Central Receiver or by the user who requested 
          an item. 
        <p>Receiving ordered items involves these basic steps (see the <a href="receiving_flow.htm">process 
          flow diagram</a> for a detailed description of the process): 
        <ol>
          <li>The user receives ordered items and verifies that they match those 
            specified in the original request.</li>
          <li class="helpListPad">On the Home page, the user clicks <b>Receive</b> 
            in the &quot;swoosh&quot; or central image, or <b>Purchase Orders</b> 
            in the Navigation Panel, to search for and select the order associated 
            with the items received. 
            <p>If you have overdue receipts and you are the first approver in 
              the approval flow for those receipts, an <b>Overdue Receipts</b> 
              link flashes in the To Do section of the Navigation Panel. The Receive 
              link is always available for you to review or edit older receipts, 
              if necessary.</p>
          </li>
          <li>The user enters the receipt details, which can include partial receipts 
            and rejections, and then submits the receipt for approval. </li>
          <li class="helpListPad">Approvers approve or deny the receipt (and <a href="javascript: openGlossary('../../../common/glossary/receipt_tracker.htm');">receipt 
            tracker</a>, if applicable). If the receipt is denied, the user must 
            take appropriate action to resolve the problem, and continue the receiving 
            process until all items are received or until the order is closed 
            short. </li>
          <li class="helpListPad">When all items are received, the order status 
            change from Receiving to Received and the process is finished. </li>
        </ol>
