            <p>A list of items that have been ordered, but not yet acknowledged 
              as received. My Supply Cabinet calculates the due date for an item, based 
              on the supplier's estimated lead time. If the item is not received 
              by the estimated due date, it is listed as overdue. Items typically 
              become overdue when the requester fails to acknowledge receipt of 
              the item, or the supplier fails to deliver as promised. </p>
