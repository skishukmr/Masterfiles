        <p>My Supply Cabinet, an integral part of the Global Indirect Spend Transformation SIP, increases 
          your company's ability to track and control its spending by automating 
          the entire buying cycle, from purchase requisition to payment. Note that the order to payment tasks in that buying cycle will be implemented in Release 2. My Supply Cabinet enables you to efficiently buy goods and services, approve requests, or direct 
          and coordinate purchasing activities:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>If <b>you</b> <b>buy items</b>, you use My Supply Cabinet to complete a 
            purchase requisition that describes what you want to buy, and submit 
            it for approval. When your request is fully approved, My Supply Cabinet 
            creates the appropriate orders. Those orders are sent to suppliers. When you 
            receive the items, you will use My Supply Cabinet to enter receipt details in Release 2, so 
            My Supply Cabinet can finish tracking the request, order, and receipt. Your 
            purchasing department can be involved at different points in the process, 
            as necessary.</p>
          <p>If <b>you</b><b> approve requests</b>, you use My Supply Cabinet to organize, 
            view, and take action on requests. When you approve or deny requests, 
            you can edit the requests, or add comments and attachments to them. 
            You can also add or remove approvers and watchers, to ensure adequate 
            review and approval. Your purchasing department can be involved at 
            different points in the process, as necessary. </p>
          <p>If <b>you direct or coordinate purchasing activities</b>, as a purchasing 
            agent, for example, you use My Supply Cabinet to monitor and resolve transactions 
            that My Supply Cabinet flags as problematic, based on your company's business 
            rules. For example, you might be notified of problems transmitting 
            orders to suppliers, canceling orders, or pushing data to your corporate 
            systems. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My Supply Cabinet is set up and configured by your company's My Supply Cabinet 
          implementation team. They customize My Supply Cabinet to 
          reflect your company's business and operating rules, so the requisition, 
          approval, order, and other processes you follow in My Supply Cabinet conform 
          to your company's standards.</p>
        <p>Ariba Spend Management applications complement My Supply Cabinet with features 
          that further streamline and simplify the procurement process. To learn
