        <p>Use the History tab to view the history of all versions of a requisition.</p>
        <p>You can add new items to an order by adding the items to the requisition 
          from which the order originated. </p>
        <p>If My Supply Cabinet is configured to push change and cancel orders to an 
          <a href="javascript: openGlossary('../../../common/glossary/erp.htm');">Enterprise 
          Resource Planning (ERP) system</a>, you must always change and cancel 
          orders in My Supply Cabinet and not change or cancel them manually in the 
          ERP. In addition, for best results, do not receive orders using the 
          ERP; receive them using My Supply Cabinet.</p>
        <p>When a user receives items on an order that has a pending change or 
          cancel order associated with it, the associated change or cancel order 
          might become invalid, depending on the type of change. The original 
          order has a status of Receiving or Received.</p>
        <p> Typically, the Confirming/Shipping statuses in My Supply Cabinet are equivalent 
          to the Partially Confirmed/Partially Shipped statuses in Ariba SN; however, 
          rejected and back ordered items are treated differently in My Supply Cabinet 
          and Ariba SN. See the <i>My Supply Cabinet Procurement Guide</i> for more 
          information. </p>
        <p>If a requisition specified a <a href="javascript: openGlossary('../../../common/glossary/hold_until.htm');">Delay 
          Purchase Until</a> date, the requisition's status remains Approved until 
          the date the related orders are actually sent to suppliers, at which 
          time the requisition's status changes to Ordered. If you need to change 
          an approved requisition during the time it is on hold, click <b>Edit</b> 
          when viewing the requisition's details. Once the requisition's status 
          changes to Ordered, use the Change button to change the requisition</p>
        <p>Orders that have assigned PCard charges can be changed in some circumstances. 
          Depending on your system configuration, you can change these orders 
          in one of the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="helpListPad">You can change line item quantities or delete 
            line items if an order's assigned PCard charges equal 0 (zero) or 
            less. If the charges are greater than 0, you can only increase the 
            line item quantities. </li>
          <li class="helpListPad">You can change the line item quantities or delete 
            line items so that the total value of an order&#146;s line items is 
            greater then the total assigned PCard Charges for the order. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>After a requisition has been fully approved, My Supply Cabinet generates 
          orders and sends the orders to suppliers. At this point, users can change 
          or cancel orders either by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changing or canceling the <i>requisition</i> from which the orders 
            originated, using the <b>Change</b> or <b>Cancel</b> button when viewing 
            requisition details. Changing the requisition changes all related 
            orders impacted by the change. Canceling the requisition cancels all 
            related orders.</li>
          <li class="helpListPad">Changing or canceling the <i>orders</i>, using 
            the <b>Change Order</b> or <b>Cancel Order</b> button when viewing 
            order details. These options are available only if your company supports 
            them and, in that case, if you have the necessary permissions. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In both cases, a new version of the requisition is created and submitted 
          for approval, based on the current approval rules. If the new version 
          is fully approved, a new version of each order impacted by the change 
          is generated and sent to suppliers. Note that your system administrator 
          defines which fields generate new orders; it's possible to change some 
          fields, such as accounting fields, without generating new orders to 
          send to suppliers. </p>
        <p> You can change or cancel requisitions with a status of Ordered. You 
          can change or cancel orders whose status is one of the following; some 
          statuses are only for orders processed using Ariba Supplier Network 
          (Ariba SN). </p>

        <p>To change or cancel orders generated from requisitions that you submitted, 
          you must have the CancelPO or ChangePO permissions. To change or cancel 
          orders generated from requisitions submitted by other users, you must 
          have the CancelPO or ChangePO permission and the RequisitionChange permission. 
          To search for specific orders to change or cancel, regardless of who 
          submitted the orders, you must have the QueryAll permission.</p>
        <p>Changing or canceling orders involves these basic steps (see the <a href="change_order_flow.htm">process 
          flow diagram</a> for a detailed description of the process): </p>
        <ol>
          <li>An authorized user changes or cancels a requisition or order, thereby 
            generating a new version of the requisition, and submits the new version 
            for approval.</li>
          <li class="helpListPad">My Supply Cabinet notifies designated approvers that 
            the new version is waiting for their approval. </li>
          <li class="helpListPad"> Approvers approve or deny the new version: 
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li class="helpListPad">If approved and the supplier accepts <a href="javascript: openGlossary('../../../common/glossary/change_order.htm');">change 
              or cancel orders</a>, a replacement order (with the same order ID 
              as the original order) is generated. The replacement order is sent 
              to the supplier by direct order, Ariba SN, or ERP, if your company 
              has enabled ERP push of change or cancel orders. </li>
            <li class="helpListPad">If approved and the supplier does <i>not</i> 
              accept change or cancel orders, you must cancel the original order 
              (if the order's status is such that it can be canceled), and then 
              create a new order either by adding items to the existing requisition 
              or by creating a new requisition. </li>
            <li class="helpListPad">If denied, the user can either edit and resubmit 
              the new version for approval, or withdraw, edit, and then resubmit 
              it. </li>
          </ul>
          <li class="helpListPad">When the user receives the items from the supplier, 
            the user enters receipt details. </li>
