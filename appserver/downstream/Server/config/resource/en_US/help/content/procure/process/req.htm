        <p>You can withdraw an approved request only if it specifies a <a href="javascript: openGlossary('../../../common/glossary/hold_until.htm');"> 
          Delay Purchase Until</a> date.</p>
        <p>You can change or cancel a requisition whose status is Ordered. </p>
        <p>If a requisition specified a Delay Purchase Until date, the requisition's 
          status remains Approved until the date the related orders are actually 
          sent to suppliers, at which time the requisition's status changes to 
          Ordered. If you need to change an approved requisition during the time 
          it is on hold, click <b>Edit</b> when viewing the requisition's details. 
          Once the requisition's status changes to Ordered, use the Change button 
          to change the requisition.</p>
        <p>If a requisition contains line items that do not require a receipt 
          (as configured by your system administrator), those line items have 
          a status of Ordered, and not Received, when the requisition is fully 
          approved. The status of the line items does not change during the procurement 
          process; Ordered is the final status of those line items.</p>
        <p>Although order IDs are typically created in numerical sequence (for 
          example, DO1, DO2, DO3), one or more numbers can be skipped (for example, 
          DO15, DO17, DO32) due to intervening internal events. Your system administrator 
          can run a scheduled task to list all order IDs, if necessary. Note that 
          the IDs for orders processed using an external Enterprise Resource Planning 
          (ERP) system are assigned and maintained by the ERP system.</p>

        <p>A purchase requisition (PR) is an approvable document created when 
          you submit a request to purchase items, such as printer supplies. Each 
          purchase requisition is assigned a unique ID number, such as PR2394, 
          to help you and My Supply Cabinet identify and track it as it moves through 
          the requisition process. 
        <p>Purchase requisitions involve these basic steps (see the <a href="req_flow.htm">process 
          flow diagram</a> for a detailed description of the process): 
        <ol>
          <li>A user requests goods by completing a PR and submitting it for approval. 
          </li>
          <li class="helpListPad">My Supply Cabinet routes the requisition to approvers, 
            based on defined business rules, and notifies the approvers that a 
            PR requires their approval.
            <ul>
               
              <li class="helpListPad">If the requisition contains collaborative 
                items, the requisition is routed to pre-collaboration approvers 
                only, then goes through collaboration, and then continues on to 
                the remaining approvers.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="helpListPad">Approvers approve or deny the PR: 
            <ul>
              <li class="helpListPad">If the PR is fully approved, My Supply Cabinet 
                reviews the requested items, identifies distinct suppliers, and 
                creates a purchase order for each supplier. Depending on the items 
                and system configuration, My Supply Cabinet sends orders to suppliers 
                by direct order, Ariba SN, or ERP. </li>
              <li class="helpListPad">If the PR is denied, the user can either 
                edit and resubmit the PR for approval, or withdraw it. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="helpListPad">The suppliers ship the items, wait for receipt, 
            and then request payment.</li>
          <li class="helpListPad"> For each order, My Supply Cabinet determines which 
            items require receipts and tracks those receipts.</li>
          <li class="helpListPad">The user receives items and submits receipts 
            as the items arrive. If items arrive in batches, My Supply Cabinet maintains 
            partial receipts and keeps the overall receipt open until all items 
            have been received. My Supply Cabinet can also push the receipts to an ERP 
            system.</li>
