        <p>For details on using Excel spreadsheets, see the <i>Ariba Contract 
          Compliance Guide</i>. The following are some specific and general guidelines 
          for entering data into a Microsoft Excel file for later upload:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> To create a contract request from scratch with an Excel spreadsheet, 
            use the sample Excel files in the buyer/sample/contracts/sample/excelimport 
            directory as templates for common types of contracts. </li>
          <li> You cannot import contract requests containing non-catalog items 
            that use formula pricing.</li>
          <li>If you specify a non-catalog item with a supplier part number that 
            already exists for a contract item for which a supplier has not been 
            defined, then the existing item will be used in the imported Excel 
            spreadsheet instead of the non-catalog item you defined. </li>
          <li> You cannot use Excel import to update existing contract requests 
            that are already submitted or approved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Enter numbers as text format</b> </p>
        <p>All cell data must be in the Excel text format &#151; even numerical 
          data &#151; otherwise the data will not be imported correctly. However, 
          Excel automatically treats any cell entry that starts with a number 
          as a number format, not as a text format. To force a text format on 
          a numerical entry, enter an apostrophe before the first number in a 
          cell. For example, to force a price entry of 119.99 to be formatted 
          as text, type '119.99 in the cell. </p>
        <p>Or you may use this alternative method, to change all the cell formats, 
          which is useful if you've copied and pasted numerical data from another 
          Excel spreadsheet, or from another application: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select all cells in the worksheet by clicking the cell in the upper 
            left-hand corner. </li>
          <li>Click the <b>Format</b> menu and select the <b>Cells</b> option. 
          </li>
          <li>Click the <b>Number</b> tab, and select the <b>Text</b> entry in 
            the list by highlighting it. </li>
          <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button to apply the new format to the selected 
            cells.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Do not change column names</b></p>
        <p>Leave column names unchanged. When the Excel file is uploaded, data 
          in the columns are mapped into the user interface according to the column 
          names. If these column names are changed, the data under them will not 
          be recognized and will be ignored.</p>
        <p><b>Do not change worksheet names</b></p>
        <p>The Excel workbook file usually contains multiple worksheets, with 
          each worksheet containing related data, for example all contract header 
          information is specified in a Contract Header worksheet. Worksheets 
          are shown as tabs arranged at the bottom of the workbook. Click a worksheet 
          tab to show that worksheet and work on it. Do not change the name of 
          any worksheet, even if you do not enter any data into it. However, you 
          can completely delete a worksheet if you do not need it.</p>
        <p><b>Deleting unused columns</b></p>
        You can remove columns that are not required from the template. If some 
        are inappropriate for your use, delete them to simplify the template for 
        you and your team members. If you add columns to the spreadsheet, for 
        your own records or to store intermediate calculations, they are ignored 
        when uploaded, as long as they do not duplicate any column names already 
        used in the template. 
        <p><b>Excel formulas </b></p>
        <p>You cannot import worksheets that use Excel formulas to calculate cell 
          data. Excel formulas are a convenient way of ensuring accurate cell 
          calculations &#151; especially if you are often adding or deleting cells 
          while working on the worksheet, or if you are entering prices for large 
          numbers of items (requiring large numbers of cells). To use the strength 
          of Excel formulas, and still be able to import their results into your 
          Ariba module: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Add formulas to the desired cells in your spreadsheet.</li>
          <li> When you are ready to import the spreadsheet, create a copy of 
            it. </li>
          <li>In your original spreadsheet, for each worksheet that uses formulas: 
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>Select all cells, by clicking the upper left corner of the worksheet. 
            </li>
            <li>Copy the cells (click <b>Edit</b> and then <b>Copy</b>, or right-click 
              your mouse and select <b>Copy</b>).</li>
            <li>In your copied spreadsheet, go to the same worksheet. </li>
            <li>Select all cells, by clicking the upper left corner of the worksheet. 
            </li>
            <li>Do a special paste (click <b>Edit</b> and then select <b>Paste 
              Special</b>, or right-click your mouse and select <b>Paste Special</b>). 
            </li>
            <li>In the pop-up window, under &quot;Paste,&quot; select the <b>Values</b> 
              option. </li>
            <li>Click <b>OK</b>. </li>
          </ol>
          <li>After repeating this for all worksheets that use formulas, save 
            the copied spreadsheet. </li>
          <li>Import the copied spreadsheet. </li>
        </ol>
        <p> For more details about using formulas to calculate values, see the 
          Excel online help.</p>
        <p><b>Uploaded Excel data replaces UI data</b></p>
        <p>After uploading the Excel file, its data replaces any data defined 
          in the UI for the request. However, after you have imported, you can 
          still change your request data in the UI before submitting it for approval.
