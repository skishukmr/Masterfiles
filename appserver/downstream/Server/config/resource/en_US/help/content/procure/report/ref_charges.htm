        <p>These reports focus on data for charges made using a corporate purchasing 
          card (PCard) that are tracked by My Supply Cabinet. The reports help you understand 
          how employees have been using their corporate purchasing cards. You 
          can see charges that have arrived from the bank but haven't yet been 
          associated with a particular card number, and charges that are either 
          unassigned or cannot be assigned.</p>
