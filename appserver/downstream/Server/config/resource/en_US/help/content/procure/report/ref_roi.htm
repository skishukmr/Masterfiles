      <p>These reports show the time 
        and money you spend processing requests. They can show where your process 
        is working well, and highlight areas where you might improve the process 
        to maximize the benefits of using My Supply Cabinet. For example, the reports 
        might reveal that some types of requests take longer to process, indicating 
        that a change in process could reduce delays. </p>

          <td width="72%" class="helpBody"> The average number of days required 
            to approve requests within a specified time period, with requests 
            grouped by amount. 
         Typically, requests with lower amounts take less approval time 
              because fewer people are involved in the approval process. If the 
              report indicates otherwise, you might want to reevaluate the criteria 
              on which approval flows are based, or change the monetary limits 
              that trigger approvals.

            report to reveal trends in how you purchase goods over a period of 
            time. The report is also useful for determining My Supply Cabinet usage. 
            For example, you can compare the amount spent each month using My Supply Cabinet against the total amount spent, to determine the percentage 
            of request volume being sent through My Supply Cabinet. </td>

            items and non-catalog items during a specified time period. This report 
            helps you evaluate whether a catalog meets your needs. For example, 
            if more money is consistently spent on non-catalog items, and if the 
            same non-catalog items are consistently ordered, you can arrange to 
            have those items added to a catalog to reduce costs. </td>
